# Socketlog

A simple React Native application built on Expo that helps backend developers to easily test server side socket.io implementations. ðŸš€

## Overview

This project was created with the purpose to improve a way to test socket.io technology implemented on server side. So developers can easily authenticate to the server over jwt, get the returned token and pass it over socket handshake to keep socket.io secure and associated to the user. Exposing all the socket events on app screen as a log to test if events is triggering.

## Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [React Native][rn] - As a development technology. 
- [Expo][expo] - As a building platform. 
- [socket.io][socketio] - As a websocket communication.

## How to use

Basically to use this project, your server must to implement some patterns and it need to be mapped on socketlog `.env` file:

1 - A `jwt` authentication over API HTTP Request that returns a `jwt token`.

2 - A `jwt` verification on server socket.io when receive a new connection. 
```js
  const jsonwebtoken = require('jsonwebtoken');
  const io = require('socket.io')(server);
  io.on('connect', async function (socket) {
    try {
      const { jwt } = socket.handshake.query
      const payload = await jsonwebtoken.verify(jwt, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
      socket.join("socketlog")     
      io.to("socketlog").emit("socketlog", "Hello World")    
    } catch (error) {
      socket.disconnect()
    }
  });
```

3 - Configure socketlog `.env` file to fit your environment
```txt
SERVER_URL=http://localhost
SERVER_PORT=1337
API_AUTH_ENDPOINT=/auth/local
API_AUTH_USER_FIELD=identifier
API_AUTH_PASS_FIELD=password
API_RESPONSE_JWT_FIELD="jwt"
```

## That's all, folks

I hope this project help you to save some time of server socket.io tests.
